The history of dogs is deeply connected with that of humanity.
Scientists believe dogs were the first domesticated animals, evolving from wolves
that began following human camps for food. Over centuries, humans and dogs developed
a unique partnership built on trust and cooperation.

Today, dogs serve in hundreds of roles. Guide dogs assist the visually impaired,
therapy dogs comfort patients in hospitals, and search-and-rescue dogs save lives
after natural disasters. Each breed has unique characteristics suited to its tasks,
from the agility of Border Collies to the keen noses of Bloodhounds.

Dogs also appear in literature, film, and art â€” symbols of loyalty, protection, and joy.
Their presence in human culture reflects our deep emotional connection to them.

Adopting a dog is a long-term commitment that brings endless rewards.
Dogs teach empathy, responsibility, and the simple power of love.
No matter their breed or size, every dog has the potential to change a life.
